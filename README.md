Safeconvert is a youtube converter that can take a youtube video, download it and convert it to a diferent file type.
It required ffmpy* and ctypes
To set up ffmpy, use pip install ffmpy then follow the instructions on this website: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/
I included a .ico file in the repository if you want to create a shortcut to the script.

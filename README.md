Safeconvert is a quick script i made to not have to use those sketchy youtube to mp3 or mp4 websites
it uses pytube, os, tkinter, and time (some come preinstalled im pretty sure)
it is a simple program using terminal
i have inclided a .ico file incase you would like to create a shortcut for it
it takes about 2-5 seconds to download an average video
Disclaimer: this script isnt truly less or more "sketchy" than any other youtube to mp3 or mp4 websites, i do not own any of the videos or audios downloaded
